*Data analysis final project of System Analysis and Decision Support Methods.*

Aim of the project was to analyze League of Legends games and try to predict its level based on many game features.

I gathered data from Riot Games API, transformed and analyzed. 10000 matches were analyzed in total, 1000 each rank (Iron,Bronze...).


Here, full raport of my work (in polish). [Raport.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19089671/Raport.pdf)


TL;DR

Best models predicts level within 1 division (1 up and 1 down) with 95% accuracy. Which is quite impressing based on simplicity of chosen features.
